# integrity-plugin
This Jenkins plugin provides SCM integration capabilities to PTC Integrity for Configuration Management.

Refer to https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PTC+Integrity+Plugin for complete details

# Licensing
PTC Integrity plugin does not require any explicit license currently, however, the mksapi.jar which is used by the plugin (to connect to Integrity Lifecycle Manager server from Jenkins) is a proprietary PTC jar and hence has its own PTC license. Integrity Lifecycle Manager users get this mksapi.jar (and its license) bundled with the Integrity Lifecycle Manager server

# Development
Being an Open Source software, it follows all the standards for being an open source software, the intention is to have a collaborative software development where developers across community can contribute to the plugin that benefits other users. PTC expects the community to contribute to the development of the plugin and developers can submit their code to the GIT hub location as pull requests. The submissions are reviewed by PTC periodically and if deemed fit to be productized, PTC will merge the submissions into mainline and release as a new version of the plugin. PTC may from time to time contribute to the project as well.
# Pricing
The plugin is free of cost

# Support
Refer PTC Integrity Plugin wiki page for notes on how to install, configure and use the plugin. Refer open issues on this JIRA page. Users can also file new issues here.
